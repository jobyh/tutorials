title: Strings, Integers, Floats &amp; Booleans
---

In this tutorial, we're going to look at the basic data types in PHP. These basic
types are known as 'scalar' types:
- **Strings** &ndash; used to display text (think of a 'string' of characters)
- **Integers** &ndash; whole number numeric values e.g. 4, 7, 3000000, 42
- **Floats** &ndash; numbers with a 'floating' point. The floating part means there
  isn't a fixed number of places after the point e.g. 1.2, 43.002, 0.01 are all floats
- **Booleans** &ndash; either 'true' or 'false' it's as simple as that ü§ì

In this tutorial we'll work in PsySH the REPL we installed in the
[Installing PHP](/php/lesson0/tutorial.html) tutorial. Fire up your Terminal and type in
`psysh` then press return.

_**Tip**: If you need to exit PsySH press `Ctrl + C`_


## Strings
You may have already seen this coding tradition before. We'll start by printing "Hello, World!"
to the console. Type the following after the PsySH prompt (`>>>`) followed by return:

```php
echo 'Hello, World!'
```

You should see the text `Hello, World!` output on the next line. The `echo` part here is a PHP
language construct which expects to be followed by a String to output. The String is the group
of characters surrounded by single quotes. Try typing your own message.

You can also write Strings using double quotes in PHP. This can be useful when you need to
output a string which _contains_ either single or double quotes. First try this:

```php
echo 'It's PHP day'
```

üêû Erk! You _should_ have seen an error message about an "unexpected T_STRING". This is because the single quote in `It's` is actually terminating the string early then PHP doesn't understand the `s PHP day'` characters after it. Let's try using double quotes to wrap the same string:


```php
echo "It's PHP day"
```

üéâ you should now see the string output correctly in PsySH.

What if we need to use double quotes in our string? We can do something similar the other way around:

```php
echo '"What larks, Pip" said Joe'
```

There are also some other useful differences between Strings using single and double quotes
but we'll get to those in a later tutorial.


If you have two strings and want to join them together in PHP you use a dot `.` 
The programming term for joining strings together is _concatenation_. Type the following in PsySH and press enter:

```php
echo 'one, ' . 'two, ' . 'three!'
```

## Integers &amp; Floats

You can use integers and floats to perform arithmetic in PHP using a handful of operators. In PsySH type the following
and press return to see the result:

```php
6 - 2
```

or

```php
3 + 9.5
```

Multiplication and division use the `*` and `/` operators:

```php
2.25 * 4
```

or

```php
12 / 3 + 1
```

In the last example the result is 5 as PHP carries out the multiplication _before_ adding one. If you studied Maths you might remember the [BODMAS (or BIDMAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations#Mnemonics) mnemonic which describes
the order in which operations are carried out. If we want PHPto change this order so that 12 is divided by the result of
3 + 1 we can use brackets to group the addition:

```php
12 / (3 + 1)
```

We can even use brackets to group brackets if we want to get decadent:

```php
(12 / (3 + 1)) * 8
```

There's also an interesting modulo operator `%` which will give the remainder after dividing one number by another.
Try these out in PsySH:

```php
12 % 4
```

and

```php
11 % 4
```

Modulo might seem a bit impractical right now but we'll see later how it can be used to theme alternating stripes
in a web page.

## Booleans

Named after Lincolnshire mathematician George Boole who worked on algebraic logic. Booleans represent an on or
off or 'true' / 'false' value and are usually used in control structures to change what's happening in a program.
Use PsySH to evaluate `true` and `false`. Spoiler &ndash; don't get toooo excited üòú

Booleans in PHP are case-insensitive which means all the following are valid `true`, `True`, `FALSE`, `falsE`, `fAlSE` 

&hellip; but we'll stick to all lowercase as this is the standard form [agreed by the PHP community](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)
and writing it like `fAlSE` looks a bit crackers and is difficult to read.

## Switching between types

Lastly a quick heads-up about how PHP works with types. Like JavaScript, PHP is a _weakly typed_ language
('type' as in 'types of things' not 'she typed on a keyboard').

This means that PHP will try its best to 'do the right thing' if you use a data type in the wrong place.
As we will see 'doing the right thing' is somewhat subjective. Remember how `echo` expects a String in
our "Hello, World!" example above? 

Use PsySH to evaluate this code:

```php
echo true
```

What was the result and was it what you expected?

The reason this happens is that PHP _turns the Boolean into a string_. Similar to JavaScript PHP has some
predefined steps for converting between types and these aren't always quite what you'd expect.

_Strongly_ typed languages like Java or C# will not coerce values into different types and your program would exit with an error.

You can coerce types manually in PHP. This explicit type coercion is known as 'casting'. Use PsySH and precede
a value with the type you want to convert it to in brackets. One of:
- **String**: `(string)`
- **Integer**: `(int)`
- **Float**: `(float)`
- **Boolean**: `(bool)`

e.g.

```php
(string)false
```

The above casts a Boolean to a String. Use PsySH to experiment casting values to different types.

Don't worry about trying to learn the steps PHP uses to convert (coerce) types any time soon. Just be aware it does this
if you see unexpected values when debugging your programs üòä

## Recap

We learned about the basic data types we'll be working with in PHP:

- String
- Integer
- Float
- Boolean

We also learned how to use PsySH (our REPL) to experiment with PHP types and that we can exit PsySH using `Ctrl + C`.

Next we'll learn how to store these values in [variables and arrays](/php/lesson2/tutorial.html)
